//! Domain-agnostic computational geometry library.
//!
//! Provides fundamental geometric primitives (2D and 3D), transformations,
//! polygon operations, collision detection, and spatial indexing for the
//! U-Engine ecosystem.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - **`primitives`**: Core types — `Point2`, `Vector2`, `Segment2`, `AABB2`,
//!   `Point3`, `Vector3`, `AABB3`
//! - **`polygon`**: Polygon operations — area, centroid, convex hull, winding
//! - **`transform`**: Rigid transformations — `Transform2D`, `Transform3D`
//! - **`robust`**: Numerically robust geometric predicates (Shewchuk)
//! - **`collision`**: SAT-based collision detection (2D convex polygons), AABB
//!   overlap (2D and 3D)
//! - **`minkowski`**: Minkowski sum and NFP for convex polygons
//! - **`spatial_index`**: Linear-scan spatial indices for 2D and 3D AABB queries
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! This crate sits at Layer 2 (Algorithms) in the U-Engine ecosystem.
//! It contains no domain-specific concepts — nesting, packing, scheduling, etc.
//! are all defined by consumers at higher layers.
//!
